**A Storied History**

The journey of Monty's began in 1940 when Monty Levine opened the original restaurant in Pasadena. In 1947, Monty bought out his partner and renamed the establishment after himself, becoming a favorite among sports fans and USC students. After 66 years, the Pasadena location closed in 2007, but the legacy continued with the opening of the Woodland Hills location in 1957. Today, the restaurant is proudly operated by the third generation of the Levine family, ensuring that the traditions and standards set by Monty himself are upheld.
