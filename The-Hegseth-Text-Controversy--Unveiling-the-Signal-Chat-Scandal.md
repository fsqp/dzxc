In recent weeks, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has found himself at the center of a significant controversy involving the sharing of sensitive military information through the encrypted messaging app Signal. This incident has raised serious concerns about national security protocols and the handling of classified information within the Trump administration.

**The Signal Chat Revelation**

Reports emerged that Hegseth, along with other senior national security officials, shared detailed plans of a military airstrike targeting Houthi militants in Yemen via a private Signal group chat. The group included Hegseth's wife, brother, personal lawyer, and several close associates. The disclosed information encompassed specific times of warplane launches, strike packages, and target detailsâ€”data typically classified to protect operational security.
